<h1>Colophon<a class="headerlink" href="#colophon" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>We are composers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.trevorbaca.com">Trevor Bača</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://josephine-wolf-oberholtzer.com">Joséphine Wolf Oberholtzer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.victoradan.net">Víctor Adán</a>, creators of Abjad. Our earliest collaborative work dates
back to shared undergraduate years in Austin. It was the mid- to late-90s and we found
ourselves interested in ways of building up ever larger sets of musical materials in our
scores, with ever greater amounts of musical information.</p>
<p>Our work then began with pitch formalization, creating materials in C and then writing
the results as MIDI to hear what we’d created. Turns out that this is a fairly common
gateway into materials generation for many composers, and so it was for us. Probably this
was, and is, due to the ever present availability of MIDI and, to a lesser extent,
CSound.  But even back then it was clear to us to finding ways to embody other aspects of
the musical score – from nested rhythms to the different approaches to the musical
measure to the arbitrarily complex structures possible with overlapping musical voices –
would require a wholly different level of consideration, and different development
techniques as well.</p>
<p>As an example, consider flat lists of floating-point values. This basic data structure,
together with the constant need some type of quantification or rounding, feeds much of
most composers’ work with CSound, pd and the like. It is a good thing, therefore, that
essentially all modern programming languages include tools for manipulating flat lists of
floats out of the box, or in the standard library. But what happens when you want to
think of pitch as something much more than integers for core values with, perhaps, floats
for microtones? What if you want to work with pitches as fully-fledged objects? Objects
capable of carrying arbitrarily large sets of attributes and values? Objects that might
group together, first into sets, and then into larger assemblages, and then into still
larger complexes of pitch information loaded, or even overloaded, with
cross-relationships or textural implications? Carrying this surplus of information about
pitch, or the potential uses of pitch, in data structures limited to, or centered around,
the list-of-floats paradigm then becomes a burden.</p>
<p>And what of working with rhythms not only as offset values, as implied by the
list-of-floats approach, but as arbitrarily nested, stretched, compressed and stacked
sets of values, as allowed by the tupletting and measure structures of conventional
score? A different approach is needed.</p>
<p>There was, and still is, no reason to believe that general purpose programming languages
and development tools should come readily supplied with the objects and methods most
suitable for composerly applications.  And this means that the attributes of a
domain-specific language that will best meet the needs of composers interested in working
formally with the full complement of capabilities in traditional score remains an open
question.</p>
<p>We continued our work in score formalization independently until 2005, Trevor in a system
that would come to be called Lascaux, and Víctor in a system dubbed Cuepatlahto. We
experimented with C, Mathematica and Matlab as the core programming languages driving our
systems before settling independently on Python, Víctor out of experienece at MIT, where
he was working on his masters at the Media Lab with Berry Vercoe, and Trevor out of the
working necessities of a professional developer and engineer.</p>
<p>We passed through independent experiences using Finale, Sibelius, Leland Smith’s SCORE,
and even Adobe Illustrator as the notational rendering engines for Lascaux and
Cuepatlahto. Through all of this, both systems were designed to tackle a shared set of
problems. These included:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The difficulty involved in transcribing larger scale and highly
parameterized gestures and textures into traditional Western notation.</p></li>
<li><p>The general inflexibility of closed, commercial music notation
software packages.</p></li>
<li><p>The relative inability of objects on the printed page in conventional
score to point to each other — or, indeed, to other objects or
ideas outside the printed page — in ways rich enough to help capture,
model and develop long-range, nonlocal relationships throughout our scores.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After collaborating on a joint paper describing the two systems, and after discussing
collaborative design and implementation at length, both online and in weekends’ long
review of our respective code-bases, we decided to combine our efforts into a single,
unified project. That project is now Abjad.</p>
<p>In our work on Abjad we strive to develop a powerful and flexible symbolic system. We
picked the phrase <em>formalized score control</em>, or <em>FSC</em>, as a nod to Xenakis, who was so
far ahead in so many ways, and also to highlight our primary project goal: to bring the
full power of modern programming languages, and tools in mathematics, text processing,
pattern recognition, and modular, iterative and incremental development to bear on all
parts of the compositional process.</p>
